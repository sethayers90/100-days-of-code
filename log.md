# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Febuary 13, 2021


**Today's Progress**: Worked through App Acacdemy Open curriculum

**Thoughts:** Decided to go through another "bootcamp" to strengthen my programming skills. Starting with the basics, we learned about basic number operators and minipulating strings. Very minimal code writing, it was mostly just writing simple "puts" statments to with what was learned.
