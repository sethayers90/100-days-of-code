# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Febuary 13, 2021


**Today's Progress**: Worked through App Acacdemy Open curriculum

**Thoughts:** Decided to go through another "bootcamp" to strengthen my programming skills. Starting with the basics, we learned about basic number operators and minipulating strings. Very minimal code writing, it was mostly just writing simple "puts" statments to with what was learned.

### Day 1: Febuary 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked through App Acacdemy Open curriculum
**Thoughts:** Decided to actually code in a code editor, because more practice is always useful. Learned about methods and conditionals in Ruby. Honestly, this is all really basic to me, but, I'm trying to keep my head on straight and push through. 

### Day 2: Febuary 17, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Finished the conditionals section and started oin loops
**Thoughts** Being that I know some programming to an extent I know how important paying attention is during this section loops are pretty vital. I had to miss a couple days becuase of mother nature but Im back 

### Day 3: Febuary 18,2021
**Today's Progress**: Finished the loops section watched the lectures in the array section
**Thoughts** It's nice to be back programming it really is reginiting my passion even though I'm just working through the basics. Loops are essential and so are arrays so I started to feel tired towards the ene of my time and decided to call it quits before my two hours was up.

### Day 4: Febuary 19, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Started the arrays section it feels a lot loops and I'm kind flying through it
**Thoughts** Tonight was a short night I'm feeling pretty tired from work this week. I'll have to make the time up tomorrow.
